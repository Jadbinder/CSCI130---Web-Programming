<h1>How to build a ladder</h1>

<p>
To construct a wooden ladder, gather the necessary materials, including hardwood for the ladder sides and softwood for the rungs. Determine the ladder's height and desired leaning angle, typically around 75 degrees, and calculate the number of evenly spaced rungs needed. Cut the ladder sides to the desired length and the rungs to a comfortable width. Mark the locations for the rungs on both ladder sides using a measuring tape and a level. Drill pilot holes or create starter holes at these locations to prevent splitting, then attach the rungs using screws or nails. Assemble the ladder by positioning the second ladder side on top of the rungs and securing it with fasteners. Optionally, add diagonal braces for increased stability and sand any rough edges. Finish the ladder with paint or wood stain if desired. Before use, perform a safety check to ensure all connections are secure and the ladder is stable. Always exercise caution when using a homemade ladder and seek assistance if you lack woodworking experience.
