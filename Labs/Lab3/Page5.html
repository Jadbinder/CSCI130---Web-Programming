By the way, Hey there,

I hope you're all doing well and staying blessed. It's been quite a journey, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude to each and every one of you who've been riding with me from day one.

From "Best I Ever Had" to "God's Plan," from the mixtapes to the platinum albums, we've shared countless moments, memories, and emotions together. It's been an incredible privilege to make music and connect with all of you around the world.

But as they say, all good things must come to an end. I've decided that it's time for me to step back from the spotlight and take a break from music for a while. It's not goodbye forever, but it's a well-deserved hiatus to recharge and refocus.

The support you've shown me throughout my career has been nothing short of amazing. Your love, your energy, your unwavering dedication - it's what's kept me going. And I want you to know that I'll carry that love with me wherever I go during this break.

In the meantime, keep chasing your dreams, keep being the incredible, diverse, and unique individuals that you are. Music has the power to change lives, to bring people together, and to inspire, and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so.

Thank you for being the best fans in the world. I'll be back before you know it, and I can't wait to share the next chapter of this journey with you.

Take care, stay safe, and remember - the best is yet to come.
